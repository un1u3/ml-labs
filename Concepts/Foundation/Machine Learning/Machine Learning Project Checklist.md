## ✅ **Machine Learning Project Checklist **

### **1️⃣ Frame the Problem & See the Big Picture**

* Define the goal in business terms.
* Understand how the solution will be used.
* Review current solutions or workarounds.
* Choose the right ML framing (supervised, unsupervised, online, batch, etc.).
* Define performance metrics aligned with the business objective.
* Identify minimum acceptable performance.
* Check for comparable problems and reusable tools.
* Gather human expertise if needed.
* Think through a manual solution.
* List and verify assumptions.

---

### **2️⃣ Get the Data**

* Identify what data you need and where to get it.
* Check storage, legal, and access requirements.
* Create a workspace.
* Obtain and store the data in a usable format.
* Protect or anonymize sensitive data.
* Verify data types and sizes.
* Set aside a test set (never peek at it).

---

### **3️⃣ Explore the Data**

* Make a copy for exploration.
* Use a notebook to document findings.
* Study each feature: type, distribution, missing values, noise, usefulness.
* Identify target attribute(s).
* Visualize data and check correlations.
* Think about manual solutions and useful transformations.
* Note extra data needs.
* Document insights.

---

### **4️⃣ Prepare the Data**

* Always keep raw data intact.
* Write reusable transformation functions.
* Clean data: fix or drop outliers and handle missing values.
* Select relevant features.
* Engineer new features if helpful.
* Scale or normalize features.

---

### **5️⃣ Shortlist Promising Models**

* Try multiple algorithms quickly (linear, SVM, tree-based, neural nets, etc.).
* Use cross-validation to compare models.
* Analyze important features and common errors.
* Do a quick round of feature tuning.
* Repeat briefly if needed.
* Pick top 3–5 diverse models.

---

### **6️⃣ Fine-Tune the System**

* Tune hyperparameters with cross-validation.
* Prefer random search or Bayesian optimization over grid search.
* Try ensemble methods for better performance.
* Use the full dataset for final training.
* Test on the untouched test set to estimate true generalization error.

---

### **7️⃣ Present Your Solution**

* Prepare clear visualizations, performance metrics, and explanations.
* Make sure results connect back to the business goal.

---

### **8️⃣ Launch, Monitor & Maintain**

* Deploy the model.
* Monitor performance over time.
* Maintain, retrain, and update with new data as needed.

---

**Key principle:**
✅ **Automate as much as possible and keep everything reproducible!**
